500,a,New Year Transportation,"New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are n cells numbered by integers from 1 to n, as a 1 × n board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.So, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of n - 1 positive integers a1, a2, ..., an - 1. For every integer i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1 the condition 1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i holds. Next, he made n - 1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. The i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) portal connects cell i and cell (i + ai), and one can travel from cell i to cell (i + ai) using the i-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (i + ai) to cell i using the i-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i one can't leave the Line World using portals.Currently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell t. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell t by only using the construted transportation system.","InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 104) and t (2 ≤ t ≤ n) — the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.The second line contains n - 1 space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.","OutputIf I can go to cell t using the transportation system, print ""YES"". Otherwise, print ""NO"".",https://codeforces.com/contest/500/problem/a,dfs and similar;graphs;implementation;*1000
115,a,Party,"A company has n employees numbered from 1 to n. Each employee either has no immediate manager or exactly one immediate manager, who is another employee with a different number. An employee A is said to be the superior of another employee B if at least one of the following is true:  Employee A is the immediate manager of employee B  Employee B has an immediate manager employee C such that employee A is the superior of employee C. The company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.Today the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all n employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees A and B such that A is the superior of B.What is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?","InputThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of employees.The next n lines contain the integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n or pi = -1). Every pi denotes the immediate manager for the i-th employee. If pi is -1, that means that the i-th employee does not have an immediate manager. It is guaranteed, that no employee will be the immediate manager of him/herself (pi ≠ i). Also, there will be no managerial cycles.",OutputPrint a single integer denoting the minimum number of groups that will be formed in the party.,https://codeforces.com/contest/115/problem/a,dfs and similar;graphs;trees;*900

1327,b,Princesses and Princes,"The King of Berland Polycarp LXXXIV has $$$n$$$ daughters. To establish his power to the neighbouring kingdoms he wants to marry his daughters to the princes of these kingdoms. As a lucky coincidence there are $$$n$$$ other kingdoms as well.So Polycarp LXXXIV has enumerated his daughters from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the kingdoms from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For each daughter he has compiled a list of kingdoms princes of which she wanted to marry.Polycarp LXXXIV is very busy, so he finds a couple for his daughters greedily one after another.For the first daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list and marries the daughter to their prince. For the second daughter he takes the kingdom with the lowest number from her list, prince of which hasn't been taken already. If there are no free princes in the list then the daughter marries nobody and Polycarp LXXXIV proceeds to the next daughter. The process ends after the $$$n$$$-th daughter.For example, let there be $$$4$$$ daughters and kingdoms, the lists daughters have are $$$[2, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 4]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, respectively.  In that case daughter $$$1$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$2$$$, daughter $$$2$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$1$$$, daughter $$$3$$$ marries the prince of kingdom $$$3$$$, leaving daughter $$$4$$$ nobody to marry to.Actually, before starting the marriage process Polycarp LXXXIV has the time to convince one of his daughters that some prince is also worth marrying to. Effectively, that means that he can add exactly one kingdom to exactly one of his daughter's list. Note that this kingdom should not be present in the daughter's list.Polycarp LXXXIV wants to increase the number of married couples.Unfortunately, what he doesn't have the time for is determining what entry to add. If there is no way to increase the total number of married couples then output that the marriages are already optimal. Otherwise, find such an entry that the total number of married couples increases if Polycarp LXXXIV adds it.If there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.For your and our convenience you are asked to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.","InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of daughters and the number of kingdoms.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of each daughter's list. The first integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le n$$$) is the number of entries in the $$$i$$$-th daughter's list. After that $$$k$$$ distinct integers follow $$$g_i[1], g_i[2], \dots, g_i[k]$$$ ($$$1 \le g_i[j] \le n$$$) — the indices of the kingdoms in the list in the increasing order ($$$g_i[1] < g_i[2] < \dots < g_i[k]$$$).It's guaranteed that the total number of daughters over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.It's also guaranteed that the total number of kingdoms in lists over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.","OutputFor each test case print the answer to it.Print ""IMPROVE"" in the first line if Polycarp LXXXIV can add some kingdom to some of his daughter's list so that the total number of married couples increases. The second line then should contain two integers — the index of the daughter and the index of the kingdom Polycarp LXXXIV should add to that daughter's list.If there are multiple ways to add an entry so that the total number of married couples increases then print any of them.Otherwise the only line should contain one word ""OPTIMAL"".",https://codeforces.com/contest/1327/problem/b,brute force;graphs;greedy;*1200
